# Output: Write Tests

## Output format

Return Markdown with:

- **Proposed test file(s)** (paths)
- **What each test covers** (bullets)
- **Test code** (fenced blocks, minimal but complete)
- **How to run** (commands, if known; otherwise say what you inferred)

If unsure about framework/paths, state the assumption clearly.
